# How to mark test as Passed or Failed in Python Behave with Appium on [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=appium-python-behave-passfail)

While performing app automation testing with appium on LambdaTest Grid, you may face a scenario where a test that you declared as fail in your local instance may turn out to be completed successfully at LambdaTest. Don't worry though! We understand how imperative it is to flag an app automation test as either "pass" or "fail" depending upon your testing requirement with respect to the validation of expected behaviour. You can refer to sample test repo [here](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python).

# Steps:

You can specify a test as passed or failed by Lambda hooks. The following is an example on how to set test result as passed or failed. If the code reaches exception, then it will be marked as failed, else as passed. The following is the AndroidStepDef.py file:

```
import sys
import os
path = os.getcwd()
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(path, os.pardir)))
from time import time
from behave import given
from appium import webdriver
import appConfig as appConf
from appium.webdriver.common.mobileby import MobileBy
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

@given("Start the android app automation test")
def startAndroidAppAutomationTest(self):
    if os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME") is None:
        username = "username" #Enter LT username here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        username = os.environ.get("LT_USERNAME")
    if os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY") is None:
        accesskey = "accesskey" #Enter LT accesskey here if environment variables have not been added
    else:
        accesskey = os.environ.get("LT_ACCESS_KEY")

    driver = webdriver.Remote(
        command_executor="https://"+username+":"+accesskey+"@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub",
        desired_capabilities=appConf.app_android_desired_caps
        )
    try:
        colorElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/color")))
        colorElement.click()

        textElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/Text")))
        textElement.click()

        toastElement = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/toast")))
        toastElement.click()

        notification = WebDriverWait(driver,20).until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((MobileBy.ID,"com.lambdatest.proverbial:id/notification")))
        notification.click()
        
        #MARKING TEST AS PASSED
        driver.executeScript("lambda-status=passed")

        driver.quit()
    except:
    
        #MARKING TEST AS FAILED
        driver.executeScript("lambda-status=failed")
        driver.quit()
```

## Run your test

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform.

For Android App:
```bash
behave --tags @androidApp
```

Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build).
